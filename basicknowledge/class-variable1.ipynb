    "In Object-oriented programming, when we design a class, we use instance variables and class variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Class, attributes can be defined into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance variables: If the value of a variable varies from object to object, then such variables are called instance variables.\n",
    "Class Variables: A class variable is a variable that is declared inside of class, but outside of any instance method or __init__() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the value of a variable is not varied from object to object, such types of variables are called class variables or static variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. Unlike instance variable, the value of a class variable is not varied from object to object,\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, Class variables are declared when a class is being constructed. They are not defined inside any methods of a class because of this only one copy of the static variable will be created and shared between all objects of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Student class, we can have different instance variables such as name and roll number because each studentâ€™s name and roll number are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, if we want to include the school name in the student class, we must use the class variable instead of an instance variable as the school name is the same for all students. So instead of maintaining the separate copy in each object, we can create a class variable that will hold the school name so all students (objects) can share it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add any number of class variables in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class variable is declared inside of class, but outside of any instance method or __init__() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, typically it is placed right below the class header and before the constructor method and other methods."
