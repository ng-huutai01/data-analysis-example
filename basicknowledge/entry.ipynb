    "# The interesting bit about Entry widgets isn’t how to style them, though. It’s how to use them to get input from a user. There are three main operations that you can perform with Entry widgets:\n",
    "# - Retrieving text with .get()\n",
    "# - Deleting text with .delete()\n",
    "# - Inserting text with .insert()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notice that Tkinter automatically centers the label above\n",
    "# the Entry widget in the window. This is a feature of .pack(), \n",
    "# which you’ll learn more about in later sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can delete text as well. This .delete() method takes an \n",
    "# integer argument that tells Python which character to remove. \n",
    "# For example, the code block below shows how .delete(0) deletes \n",
    "# the first character from Entry: \n",
    "# entry.delete(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Note that, just like Python string objects, text in an Entry \n",
    "# widget is indexed starting with 0.\n",
    "# If you need to remove several characters from an Entry, then \n",
    "# pass a second integer argument to .delete() indicating the \n",
    "# index of the character where deletion should stop. For \n",
    "# example, the following code deletes the first four letters in \n",
    "# Entry: \n",
    "# entry.delete(0, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Entry.delete() works just like string slicing. The first \n",
    "# argument determines the starting index, and the deletion \n",
    "# continues up to but not including the index passed as the \n",
    "# second argument. Use the special constant tk.END for the \n",
    "# second argument of .delete() to remove all text in Entry:\n",
    "# entry.delete(0, tk.END)\n",
    "\n",
    "# On the opposite end of the spectrum, you can also insert text\n",
    "# into an Entry widget:\n",
    "# entry.insert(0, \"Python\")\n",
    "# The first argument tells .insert() where to insert the text.\n",
    "# If there’s no text in Entry, then the new text will always \n",
    "# be inserted at the beginning of the widget, no matter what \n",
    "# value you pass as the first argument. For example, \n",
    "# calling .insert() with 100 as the first argument instead of \n",
    "# 0, as you did above, would’ve generated the same output.\n",
    "# If Entry already contains some text, then .insert() will \n",
    "# insert the new text at the specified position and shift \n",
    "# all existing text to the right: \n",
    "# # entry.insert(0, \"Real \")"
