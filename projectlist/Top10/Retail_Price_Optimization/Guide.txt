The retail industry is highly competitive, and pricing plays a crucial role in attracting customers and maximizing profits. Pricing decisions are complex and influenced by various factors such as cost of goods sold (COGS), market demand, competition, and desired profit margins. So, companies need to optimize their pricing strategies to find the middle ground that maximizes sales while maintaining profitability.
